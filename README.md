# CVE Watch

Inspired by a need during a semester of Vulnerability Assessment.  Coded for my Senior Project.

CVE Watch allows for browsing up to the minute Mitre CVE publications as well as the NVD Recent CVE Feed.
As a value-add, CVE Watch also allows the user to create watch lists of products from the CPE. The watch lists pull all relevant CVE ID's and allow the user to browse them.  CVE Watch can also import/export a single watch list and import/export all watch lists for easy portibility between installs.  The .cwl files generate arer nothing but JSON objects for compatibility with other applications that can make use of the data.

This is an alpha release and should be no where near anything in production.  CVE Watch will continue to be developed as I have time.
