          <p>CVE Watch was concieved during my semester of Vulnerability Assessment.  My group partner and I were tasked with assessing the software installed on a particular set of computers.  We underestimated the time required to search for and sort through CVE's.  I thought it would be nice if there was a program that would do this for us.  Such things existed on Linux systems but not on Windows.</p>
          <p>With CVE Watch you can create 'Watch Lists' containing products from the CPE dictionary.  The products are updated with relevant CVE data from the NVD which can later be browsed.  Watch Lists can be imported and exported.  The .cwl files created are nothing special.  They are just an array of objects making the data easily useable in many other applications where JSON can be used as a data source.</p>
          <p>CVE Watch is currently in an alpha state with development progressing as I have time.  There is a large TODO list that needs to be finished before having a release candidate publicly available.</p>
